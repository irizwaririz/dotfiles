" Vim is based on Vi. Setting `nocompatible` switches from the default
" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
" configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).
set nocompatible

"========== User Interface =========="
" Show (partial) commands in status line
set showcmd
" Turn on syntax highlighting.
syntax on
" Better command-line completion
set wildmenu
" Disable the default Vim startup message.
set shortmess+=I
" Show line numbers.
set number
" This enables relative line numbering mode. With both number and
" relativenumber enabled, the current line shows the true line number, while
" all other lines (above and below) are numbered relative to the current line.
" This is useful because you can tell, at a glance, what count is needed to
" jump up or down to a particular line, by {count}k to go up or {count}j to go
" down.
set relativenumber
" Always show the status line at the bottom, even if you only have one window open.
set laststatus=2
" Disable audible/visual bell because it's annoying.
set noerrorbells visualbell t_vb=

"==========  Tabs and Indentation =========="
" Number of visual spaces per TAB
set tabstop=4
" Number of spaces in TAB when editing
set softtabstop=4
" Number of spaces indented when reindent operations (>> and <<) are used
set shiftwidth=4
" Convert TABs to spaces
set expandtab
" Enable intelligent tabbing and spacing for indentation and alignment
set smarttab
" When opening a new line and no file-specific indenting is enabled,
" keep same indent as the line you're currently on
set autoindent

"========== Searching =========="
" This setting makes search case-insensitive when all characters in the string
" being searched are lowercase. However, the search becomes case-sensitive if
" it contains any capital letters. This makes searching more convenient.
set ignorecase
set smartcase
" Enable searching as you type, rather than waiting till you press enter.
set incsearch

"========== Movement =========="
" The backspace key has slightly unintuitive behavior by default. For example,
" by default, you can't backspace before the insertion point set with 'i'.
" This configuration makes backspace behave more reasonably, in that you can
" backspace over anything.
set backspace=indent,eol,start
" Enable mouse support. You should avoid relying on this too much, but it can
" sometimes be convenient.
set mouse+=a
" Try to prevent bad habits like using the arrow keys for movement. This is
" not the only possible bad habit. For example, holding down the h/j/k/l keys
" for movement, rather than using more efficient movement commands, is also a
" bad habit. The former is enforceable through a .vimrc, while we don't know
" how to prevent the latter.
" Do this in normal mode...
nnoremap <Left>  :echoe "Use h"<CR>
nnoremap <Right> :echoe "Use l"<CR>
nnoremap <Up>    :echoe "Use k"<CR>
nnoremap <Down>  :echoe "Use j"<CR>
" ...and in insert mode
inoremap <Left>  <ESC>:echoe "Use h"<CR>
inoremap <Right> <ESC>:echoe "Use l"<CR>
inoremap <Up>    <ESC>:echoe "Use k"<CR>
inoremap <Down>  <ESC>:echoe "Use j"<CR>

"========== Modes =========="
" 'Q' in normal mode enters Ex mode. You almost never want this.
nnoremap Q <Nop> 

"========== Plugins ==========" 
" Automatic installation of vim-plug if it's not yet installed
" https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/tips#automatic-installation
" NOTE: This won't work if the curl package is not installed
let data_dir = has('nvim') ? stdpath('data') . '/site' : '~/.vim'
if empty(glob(data_dir . '/autoload/plug.vim'))
  silent execute '!curl -fLo '.data_dir.'/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
  autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall --sync | source $MYVIMRC
endif
" NOTE: This line below is not given in the link above but it's required
" or an error will appear on execution (PlugInstall is dependent on it)
call plug#begin('~/.vim/autoload')
call plug#end()

"========== Pending =========="
" By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
" shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "
" forgetting about unsaved changes and then quitting e.g. via `:qa!`. We find
" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
" for more information on this.
" set hidden
